What Is Fortnite Battle Royale?
Like other battle royale games, Fortnite Battle Royale is a competitive shooter between 100 players as they air-drop out of a moving plane (or “battle bus”, in this case), then fight to survive as the play space slowly shrinks to force people into combat. True to the battle royale formula, you need to find all of your weapons and equipment on the map — you don’t land with anything other than a pickaxe.

While you could try attacking someone with your pick, it’s best used to harvest building materials from trees, cars and other free-standing objects so you can make your own walls, ramps and platforms.This is a carry-over from the base-defence game Fortnite Battle Royale sprang from, but this mechanic adds a new ingredient to the battle royale recipe that makes it stand apart.
